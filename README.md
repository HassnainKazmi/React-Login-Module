# Login Module
Developed a standalone login module that receives user credentials as input, validates the entered data against the stored data in the database, and upon successful login, displays the associated user information.

To access the login page, users must enter correct credentials, such as the email "hassnainkazmi07@gmail.com" and password "hello2023". To ensure access to the login page, users should click the "home" tab once the website is opened. 

**Please note that this project is currently ongoing.**

Technologies Used: React JS, JavaScript, Firebase, CSS3, & HTML5.
