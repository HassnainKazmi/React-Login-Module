# Login Module
Developed a responsive standalone login module that receives user credentials as input, validates the entered data against the stored data in the database, and upon successful login, displays the associated user information.

To ensure access to the login page, users should click the "home" tab once the website is opened. Then, users must enter the correct credentials such as the email "hassnainkazmi07@gmail.com" and password "hello2023" to see their information. 

Technologies Used: React JS, JavaScript, Firestore, CSS3, HTML5
